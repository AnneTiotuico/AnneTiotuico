### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer who is passionate about understanding and solving problems. I have experience in JavaScript/Node.js, Go, React, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, and AWS.

Most recently, I created [Cascade](https://try-cascade.github.io/), an open-source deployment tool for containerized applications built with Node.js, Express, React, Terraform's CDK for TypeScript and AWS' SDK.
